# DominatingSet

Calculates the minimun dominating set of a graph. See graph files (pg_100_99.txt) as an example of graph input.

Two algorithms implemented:

Fomin et al: Exact algorithm with complexity of O(1.93782^n)

Heuristic algorithm created by Lucas Saraiva: Complexity of O(V^3), optimal for some specific graph topologies
